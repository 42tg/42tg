I am a software developer from Hannover, Germany, with a strong interest in current
web development trends. I am always seeking to improve my skills and explore new
technologies to create innovative software solutions.

I primarily work with Typescript across various projects, and I fnd it to be a versatile
and powerful language. I’m particularly focused on using it to build microfrontend
applications, constantly looking for ways to maximize its potential in scalable web
development.

In addition to Typescript, I regularly work with Go in my professional projects. Go
has become a go-to language for me because it gets the job done effciently and is
straightforward to work with. I enjoy how its simplicity helps me stay productive while
tackling a wide range of tasks. Privately, I also enjoy experimenting with Rust, although
I haven’t used it in a professional setting yet. I am fascinated by its performance and
safety features and often explore its applications in side projects.

I am also a DevOps enthusiast, with a strong belief in the power of automation to
streamline the software development process. Whether it's setting up continuous
integration pipelines, automating deployments, or implementing monitoring and
logging systems, I’m always looking for ways to make the development cycle more
effcient and reliable.

Recently, I’ve become deeply engaged in improving the developer experience
within my organization. Acting as a bridge between development and operations,
I’ve focused on implementing tools and practices that make the development
process smoother and more productive. I’m particularly interested in enhancing the
workfows that help developers do their best work by removing friction, providing
clear paths, and enabling faster feedback loops. This role has sharpened my ability to
collaborate across teams and create environments that allow developers to thrive.
What excites me most about software development is solving complex problems.
I thrive on understanding the underlying issues in a system and crafting creative
solutions to address them. Whether it's improving my own codebase or diving into the
architecture of a broader software system, I’m always looking for ways to optimize
and enhance performance.

As a self-taught developer, I am constantly investing in my personal learning and
growth. I make it a priority to stay updated with the latest technologies and industry
practices through reading, online courses, and attending conferences.
While I’m passionate about individual development, I also value collaboration and
teamwork. I believe in fostering a strong team culture and working closely with others
to achieve the best results. Whether it’s collaborating with clients or colleagues, I
know that communication and positive team dynamics are essential to delivering
great results.

Overall, I am a passionate software developer dedicated to delivering high-quality
solutions and continually growing in my feld. I look forward to embracing new
challenges and expanding my expertise in the future.
